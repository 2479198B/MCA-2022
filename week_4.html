	<h3>Computational Analytics of Notated Music</h3>
	<h4>jSymbolic Analysis</h4>
		<p class="p">The following features were selected for the jSymbolic analysis:
			<ul class ="genlist">
				<li>Number of pitches: 43</li>
				<li>Number of pitch classes: 11</li>
				<li>Range: 47</li>
				<li>Strong tonal centres: 1</li>
				<li>Mean pitch: 64.38</li>
				<li>Mean pitch class: 5.811</li>
				<li>Most common pitch: 71</li>
				<li>Most common pitch class: 4</li>
				<li>Interval between most prevalent pitches: 7</li>
				<li>Pitch variability: 11.09</li>
				<li>Most common melodic interval: 2</li>
				<li>Stepwise motion: 0.5487</li> 
				<li>Melodic thirds: 0.1222</li>
				<li>Vertical unisons: 0.01808</li>
				<li>Parallel fifths: 0</li>
				<li>Parallel octaves: 0.001034</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="p">In addition to the recommended features, I selected features that had to do with voicing and melody since Bach's <em>Air</em> follows very traditional rules of harmony. I wanted to see where Bach diverged from these rules, and why. I selected vertical unisons, parallel fifths and parallel octaves for this reason. While jSymolic can find the above features in a piece, it does not display them and I did not find the parallel octaves with a brief look through the score. Since the piece is in a major key, I also found it relevant to include an analysis for melodic thirds.</p>
		
	<h4>Piano Roll and Pitch Histogram</h4>

	<p class="p">The Music21 python package allows us to do further analyses and to visualise the music data. The source file for the following is <a href="scores/test1.xml">test1.xml</a>. Below is a scatter plot of the pitches and pitch durations present in Bach's <em>Air</em>.</p>

	</figure>
	<br>

	<p class="p">The pitch histogram below shows that B, A and E and D are the most common pitches for this piece in D major. This is consistent with the jSymbolic analysis which finds midi note 71 (B) as the most common pitch. </p>

	<br>

	<p class="p">The piano roll shows the violin 1 part (melody) for the entire piece clearly. We can easily identify some notes based on their length, eg. the first extended F#, the final D, the short trills, as well as some cadences (imperfect mm 7-8, final perfect cadence).</p>

	<p class="p">Music21 can also collapse a score into chords. Below (or <a href="scores/chords.pdf">here</a>) is a chordified version of the first part of the score. An attempted automatic analysis (that seems to assume the piece starts in F# minor, modulates, and never goes to a tonic key) can be found <a href="scores/ChordAnalysis.pdf">here</a>. This shows the current challenges of automating musical analysis.</p>
