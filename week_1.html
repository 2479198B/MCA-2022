	<h3>Selecting the Dataset</h3>
	<h4>Dataset Theme</h4>
		<p class="p">The theme of this dataset is a partial playlist of an episode of a radio show, <em>Randy's Vinyl Tap</em>, which aired in Canda on CBC radio 2 in July 2020.</p>
		<p class="p">The dataset consists of handwritten notes on the episode and includes sing titles and artists (performrs or composers). The two-hour radio show of mostly early rock music is hosted by Randy Bachman. It is structured around a theme, which changes week-to-week. The theme of this episode is "Classically Inclined", and the episode explores the classical music influences of rock and pop music in the mid-to-late 20th century. / rock and pop music that has been influenced by classical music.<br></p>
	<h4>Challenges</h4>
		<p class="p">Working with music data comes with some challenges regarding access, curation and distribution. Some challenges might include difficulty to access specific material, such as with music that is under copyright. The rights holders, broadcasting corporations and publishers may limit how one can use the data, such as when printing lyrics requires permission, or prevent access altogether (for example, by only showing new content on a website, or limiting access to archives).</p>
		<p class="p">Another challenge is a lack of standardisation between sources of music data: for example, a streaming service may not provide as much metadata as might a databse like IMSLP. One therefore needs to search in many places to obtain different types of information about a piece of music. Similarly, with regard to curation, music coming from different sources and selected based on a theme can be more difficult to gather because of the challenges in access.</p>
		<p class="p">Finally, as music is displayed in different formats, some types of data may not exist: avant-garde tape music, for example, is rarely notated, and extracting music data out of graphical scores cannot be done in the same way as common Western notation.<br></p>
	<h4>Current Manifestations of the Data</h4>
		<p class="p">With a radio show playlist as a dataset, a broadcast recording of the show may be difficult to access as the CBC owns the broadcast and, in addition, limits much of its streamed content to users based in Canada. Scores from music outside of the public domain, such as rock and pop from the 1950s-present, are not usually found for free due to publishing restrictions.</p>
		<p class="p">The dataset, a playlist, consists of metadata (work/song title, artist/composer, and notes on influences) presented in manuscript format. There is no notation or acoustic data, and it has not been analysed. Some audio is available from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-135-randy-bachman-s-vinyl-tap">the CBC Vinyl Tap page</a>, various streaming services or as audio file downloads. It is organised in the chronological order of the episode.</p>
