\[Enter your responses to Week 1, tasks 2 and 3 here\]
## Week 1

* Task 2
  * _Identify a theme for your dataset. This will be the central, cohesive strand that will bring your data together. It can be an artist, composer, songwriter, performer, album, larger work (i.e. opera, musical, etc.), time period, genre, archival grouping, etc. You will want to be sure that you can gather all three types of data (musical scores, metadata, and audio recordings) based on your selected theme._
  
  3 types of data.
  eg record collection: metadata, audio recordings? not really. musical scores... perhaps not.
    * artists:
    * composers:
    * albums:
    * genre:
    * time period:
  
  
* Task 3
  * _Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed._
